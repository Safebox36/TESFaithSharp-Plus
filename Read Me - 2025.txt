Guess it's my turn.

To those who came before me, thank you for this tool.
To those who will come after me, I hope you've added useful features.

Anyway, this is a 20-year overdue upgrade of TESFaith# which itself is a one year upgrade of TESFaith.
Requires .NET 4.4 to run.

Those ReadMes still apply, and it's recommended that you read those before reading this.

I've made several bug fixes, far too numerous to list, so if any new ones crop up then please inform me.
New features include:
- shortcut keys
- in-app CELL list
- named CELL highlighting
- REGION highlighting
- clearer Batch Processs instructions
- cleaner UI
- a lovely little icon of the Vivec Statue

Same licences apply as before, remember to credit myself (BNK), Timeslip, and Lightwave.
You are free to do as you with with this code otherwise.
